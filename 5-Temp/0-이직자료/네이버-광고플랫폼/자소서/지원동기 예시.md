 I have been working as a web developer for three years, mainly using React and Node.js. I have developed various web applications, such as e-commerce, social media, and online education platforms. I am interested in applying to the advertisement platform position because I want to learn more about the latest technologies and trends in digital marketing. I think Naver is a leading company in this field, with its innovative products such as Naver Search Advertising and Naver Shopping. I believe I can contribute to the development and improvement of Naverâ€™s advertisement platform with my skills and experience.
